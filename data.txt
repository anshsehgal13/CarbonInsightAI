abstract
Carbon footprint (CF) refers to the total amount of carbon dioxide and its equivalents emitted due to various
anthropogenic activities. Carbon emission and sequestration inventories have been reviewed sector-wise for
all federal states in India to identify the sectors and regions responsible for carbon imbalances. This would
help in implementing appropriate climate change mitigation and management strategies at disaggregated
levels. Major sectors of carbon emissions in India are through electricity generation, transport, domestic
energy consumption, industries and agriculture. A majority of carbon storage occurs in forest biomass and
soil. This paper focuses on the statewise carbon emissions (CO2, CO and CH4), using region specific emission
factors and statewise carbon sequestration capacity. The estimate shows that CO2, CO and CH4 emissions
from India are 965.9, 22.5 and 16.9 Tg per year, respectively. Electricity generation contributes 35.5% of total
CO2 emission, which is followed by the contribution from transport. Vehicular transport exclusively
contributes 25.5% of total emission. The analysis shows that Maharashtra emits higher CO2, followed by
Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. The carbon status, which is the ratio of
annual carbon storage against carbon emission, for each federal state is computed. This shows that small
states and union territories (UT) like Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where
carbon sequestration is higher due to good vegetation cover, have carbon status 41. Annually, 7.35% of total
carbon emissions get stored either in forest biomass or soil, out of which 34% is in Arunachal Pradesh,
Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Orissa.

1. Introduction
Carbon footprint is a synonym for emissions of carbon dioxide
or other greenhouse gases (GHGs) expressed in carbon dioxide
equivalents. This has been used as an environmental indicator to
understand and quantify the main emission sources and it
constitutes as an effective tool for energy and environment
management. It helps us to determine the quantity of emission
from different carbon emitting sectors, which in turn is useful for

quantifying the impact of human activities on the environment
and global climate. Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has been rising alarmingly in the post industrial revolution
era and the current level is about 379 ppm (ppm¼parts per
million) compared to 280 ppm earlier (pre industrialisation).
The Planning Commission of the Government of India advocates
in the 12th Five-Year Plan of the country for low carbon growth.
The proposed actions will reduce India’s emission intensity from
20% to 25% by 2020 with respect to the emissions in 2005. This
includes policy interventions to reduce emission intensity
through fuel-efficiency standards, green building codes and
energy efficiency certificates. In this context, numerous challenges that are to be addressed include the burgeoning population
coupled with urbanisation, industrialisation and provision of
infrastructure and transport facilities. This necessitates decentralised mitigation strategies to minimise carbon emissions which
require sector wise and region wise inventory of GHG emissions.
National GHG emission inventories based on United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) aid in this
regard for evolving mitigation policies and action plans.
The national inventories of emission and sequestration provide
a general guideline for assessing the mitigation alternatives [1].
Statewise estimates of emission inventories help to understand
the major sources and sinks of carbon at regional levels. It also
helps to understand the carbon flux and facilitate in the implementation at local levels by sector wise mitigation policies.
Carbon footprint at local level helps in aligning climate policy
with local development, sharpening the awareness of municipal
stakeholders about the links between local activities and
climate change and local benchmarks against a city’s own
historical emissions [2]. Environmentally extended input–output
analysis (EE-IOA) has long been recognised as a useful top–down
technique to attribute pollution or resource use to final demand
in a consistent framework [3–5]. Interest for EE-IOA has increased
with the significant increase of interest in consumption-based
emission and resource accounting. Consumption-based accounting focussing on GHG has become relevant for policy and decision
making. This approach, where all emissions occurring along the
chains of production and distribution are allocated to the final
consumer of products, is seen as providing several opportunities.
Consumption-based accounting (CBA) complements the territorial-based approach [6,7] by including all drivers of GHG emissions
associated with consumption.
Consumption based GHG emission inventory varies with
income and urbanisation. Carbon footprint of twelve metropolitan
cities, with inter and intra variability in metropolitan areas and
found Delhi has lowest per capita CF of 0.70 metric ton with
lowest per capita income of $950 whereas Los Angeles and New
York both with higher per capita income of $46,040 have CF of
3.69 and 1.94 metric ton respectively due to higher consumption
pattern [8]. Urbanisation has changed our lifestyle as well as
consumption pattern. Carbon footprint analysis of metropolitan

America using national database through transportation and
residential sectors show that per capita carbon emissions vary
substantially as large metropolitan areas offer greater energy and
carbon efficiency [9]. Study on housing sectors reveals that wood
intensive houses store more embodied carbon compared to
normal modern houses [10]. Current Indian population has
crossed 1200 million according to the Directorate of Census
Operation, with approximately 28% living in urban areas. This
share is predicted to increase to about 40% by 2021 [11]. India and
China account for 51% of incremental world primary energy
demand in 2006–2030 as per WEO [12]. Urban areas in these
countries are the prime energy demand and also GHG emission
centres. An inventory of the energy status and carbon emissions
of 54 South Asian cities, including 41 cities from India, based on
the city energy consumption and related carbon emissions show
that major metropolitan/urbanized and industrialised regions
have higher GHG emission [1,13].
The demand for energy has been increasing with urbanisation
and burgeoning population. Electricity, fuel wood, kerosene and
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) are used for cooking and lighting
in rural and urban areas in India. Estimates indicate that in urban
areas, per capita per month consumption of firewood, electricity,
kerosene and LPG are 6.65 kg, 22.32 kWh, 0.22 l and 1.81 kg,
respectively. The total installed capacity of electricity generation
has increased from 16 GW in 1971 to 174 GW in 2009 [14].
Socio-economic growth coupled with the boost in the infrastructure sector during the post globalisation era has enhanced
the growth of cement and steel industries. The production of
cement has increased to 181.61 mt in year 2008–09 as against
168.31 mt in year 2007–08. Similarly, the crude steel production
shows annual growth of 1.23% [15]. However, these increases in
cement and steel production have enhanced carbon emissions
surpassing natural sequestration of carbon.
Forest vegetation and soil are major carbon sinks. In 2005,
India’s forest cover was spread in an area of 677,088 km2 and it
accounted for 20.6% of the total geographical area of the country,
whereas, tree cover accounted for 2.8% of India’s geographical
area [16,17]. The greater forest cover is proportional to greater
carbon storage because forest soil has the potential to sequester
carbon. Also, improvements in agricultural practices would
increase the quantity of organic carbon in soil [18].
In this context, decentralised inventory of carbon emission viaa-vis sequestration potential at disaggregated levels would help
in implementing carbon capture strategies. This requires sector
wise analysis of sources and sinks at disaggregated levels and
region specific mitigation measures depending on the sources.
The focus of this work is to develop the state wise carbon balance
inventory for India. Electricity generation, transport, industries,
domestic energy, agriculture and waste disposal sectors are
considered for emission estimates. Forest biomass, forest soil
and agricultural soil are considered for carbon sequestration. This
is done based on the compilation of data from each sector in all
states of India and through the review of the emission and sink
experiments carried out in India and India specific IPCC default
emission factors [1,19,20].
